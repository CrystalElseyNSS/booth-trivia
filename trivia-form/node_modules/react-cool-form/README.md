- üöÄ Highly performant, [minimizes the number of re-renders](https://react-cool-form.netlify.app#performance-matters) for you.
- üß± Seamless integration with existing HTML form fields or [3rd-party UI libraries](https://react-cool-form.netlify.app/docs/3rd-party-ui-libraries).

## Quick Start

To use React Cool Form, you must use `react@16.8.0` or greater which includes hooks. This package is distributed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cool-form).

```sh
$ yarn add react-cool-form
# or
$ npm install --save react-cool-form
```

Here's the basic concept of how does it rock:

[![Edit RCF - Quick start](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/rcf-quick-start-j8p1l?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark)

```js
import { useForm } from "react-cool-form";

const Field = ({ label, id, error, ...rest }) => (
  <div>
    <label htmlFor={id}>{label}</label>
    <input id={id} {...rest} />
    {error && <p>{error}</p>}
  </div>
);

const App = () => {
  const { form, getState } = useForm({
    // (Strongly advise) Provide the default values just like we use React state
    defaultValues: { username: "", email: "", password: "" },
    // The event only triggered when the form is valid
    onSubmit: (values) => console.log("onSubmit: ", values),
  });
  // React Cool Form filters the error of an un-blurred field by default (via the "filterUntouchedError" option)
  // Which helps the user focus on typing without being annoying
  const errors = getState("errors", { filterUntouchedError: true });

  return (
    <form ref={form} noValidate>
      <Field
        label="Username"
        id="username"
        name="username"
        // Support built-in validation
        required
        error={errors.username}
      />
      <Field
        label="Email"
        id="email"
        name="email"
        type="email"
        required
        error={errors.email}
      />
      <Field
        label="Password"
        id="password"
        name="password"
        type="password"
        required
        minLength={6}
        error={errors.password}
      />
      <input type="submit" />
    </form>
  );
};
```
